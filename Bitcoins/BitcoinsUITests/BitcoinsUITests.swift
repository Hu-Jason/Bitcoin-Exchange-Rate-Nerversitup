    //MARK: I tried to writing UI test, but everytime I click the red Record button at the bottom of the editor window to record my interactions as test commands, the test crashes. Xcode reports an error infomation as bellow:
    //Thread 1: "[<_UINavigationBarContentViewLayout 0x7f8954f20830> valueForUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key inlineTitleView."
    //I googled it. I found that it is a common issue on Xcode 14. https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/712240

    //This is a bug in Xcode 14. Other users have reported it here: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/712240
    //Initially, the issue was reported in Xcode 14 betas, but the bug was never fixed, and now, here we are. I reproduce the issue in the official release of Xcode 14.0.1.
